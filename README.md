## üìñ Abstract

Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key feature for sixth-generation (6G) networks, providing an opportunity to meet the dual demands of communication and sensing. Existing ISAC research primarily focuses on baseband optimization at individual access points, with limited attention to the roles of electromagnetic (EM) shaping and network-wide coordination. The intricate interdependencies between these domains remain insufficiently explored, leaving their full potential for enhancing ISAC performance largely untapped. To bridge this gap, we consider multi-domain ISAC optimization integrating EM shaping, baseband processing, and network cooperation strategies that facilitate efficient resource management and system-level design. We analyze the fundamental trade-offs between these domains and offer insights into domain-specific and cross-domain strategies contributing to ISAC performance and efficiency. We then conduct a case study demonstrating the effectiveness of joint multi-domain optimization. Finally, we discuss key challenges and future research directions to connect theoretical advancements and practical ISAC deployments. This work paves the way for intelligent and scalable ISAC architectures, providing critical insights for their seamless integration into next-generation wireless networks.
